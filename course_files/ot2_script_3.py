    # Transfer water to the mastermix (315 uL) p300.transfer(200, Water, Mastermix) p300.transfer(115, Water, Mastermix)
    # In the code below the p20 pipette is used to transfer 10 uL of dNTPs to the
    # mastermix tube
    # The p20 pipette should be used to transfer liquid between 2 and 20 uL
    # For volumes above 20 uL, the p300 pipette can be used p20.transfer(10, dNTPs, Mastermix)
    # Here, a mixing event by pipetting up and down will occur after the Q5 polymerase
    # has been transferred. The mixing will occur by pipetting 20 uL of liquid in the
